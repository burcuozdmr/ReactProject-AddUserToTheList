## Overview

- Add new users to the list

- Prevent submission if input fields are empty

- Warn the user with error modal in case of error

## My process

### Built with

- React
- Module Css (visual style)

### What I learned

This was the first application I tried to make after learning the basics of React. 
In general, it only includes the use of react basics. 
I did this to repeat and reinforce some of the information I learned. 

In practice, I experienced these ones: 

 - using useState to update the interface, 

 - using props to pass data between components, 

 - using wrapping components, 

 - trying to keep React components as simple as possible by organizing well, 

 - using module css to isolate style files of the components.
